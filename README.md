Hello!
This is my first repo and I have decided to make RGB Filters using Matlab.

MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages

-> I have taken an image from the internet(RGB) and then pasted the image in the MAtlab bin directory.
-> I have used imread function to read the image which i downloaded. See [Matlab Documentation](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/) to know more about the matlab functions.
-> An image is considered a 3 X 3 matrix in Matlab. For my case the dimensions were 256 X 256 X 3.
-> Now, in order to add a red flter, I have set values of "Green" and "Blue" components to 0. I have repeated the similar technique to apply the Red  and Blue filter.
-> Finally, I have shown all the filters using the [imread](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html?searchHighlight=imread&s_tid=srchtitle_imread_1) and the [Subplot](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html?s_tid=doc_ta) functions.

I hope you enjoy the code and I am open to pull requests!
